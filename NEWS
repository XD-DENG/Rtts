Rtts V0.33 (Release data: 2015-11-07)
==============

Changes:
* Function “tts_google” is deprecated in this version.

* The voice files generated will no longer be saved into the working directory. Instead, they will be saved in a temporary folder and the path will be given. Users can also specify the directory they prefer to save the voice files.




Rtts V0.32 (Release data: 2015-09-01)
==============

Changes:
* Some minor changes are made to address the ITRI server responde issue. The ITRI server responds extremely slowly sometimes, and this may cause "Timed out" error. Here I mainly use try() function to control this issue. If the server responds slowly, the "tts_ITRI_**" function family will print reminding instead of returning ERROR message.
